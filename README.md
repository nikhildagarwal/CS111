Intro Computer Science Course @ rutgers

Hi! In this repository is all of my course projects from Rutgers Universities CS111 computer science course from fall of 2020.
All of the code is in Java, exploring everything from math in java to arrays, recursion, and objects.
Projects of significance : WeatherGenerator.java;
                           Sierpinski.java;
                           ScenarioAnalysis.java;
                           PolygonTransform.java;
                           HeartTransplant.java;
                           HelloWorld.java (Its what started it all :) )
